# Hi, I’m Jakub 👋
aka @zych3, a 20yo C++ & GameDev enthusiast and Junior Technology Programmer at Techland. Oh, I'm also chasing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science on Warsaw's PJAIT ⛩️.

## A little boring piece about me 🤓☝️
I'm super interested in Game Engines, Rendering, Mathematics and Operating Systems.
 Learning those has never been a chore for me, literally event after coming back from parties I can sit and watch cpp stuff for hours straight 🗿.

## What do the present and the future hold? 🤔⌛
I'm currently learning advanced C++, Vulkan, Assembly and CPU/GPU Architecture-related topics. In the meantime I'm learning some Rust basics, for a little razzle-dazzle.
My madman goal is to create a game engine only using C++, SFML and FMT for logging (and I'll do it one day, just lemme graduate first!!!)
And my career goal? We'll see where it goes ig, but I know for sure I'm not leaving gamedev in near future :>
